# Call Center Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

I created a Call Center Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key metrics in call center operations. The dashboard helps managers monitor performance, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Solved

The dashboard addresses the challenge of manually tracking and analyzing large volumes of call center data by providing a clear, interactive view of:

- **Call Volume**: Monitoring calls received, handled, and abandoned.
- **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: Tracking efficiency in call resolution.
- **Agent Performance**: Comparing agent productivity and effectiveness.
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Measuring customer feedback and service quality.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preparation.
